## Ian Varonin's Blog

Hi there! My name is Ian Varonin and I have been obsessed with finding edges since I picked up poker as a part-time job during college. After graduating, I took a shot a playing poker profressionally (wasn't for me) and eventually found my passion in data science. I love to compete, which these days tends to mean trying to pick more sports games correctly than my friends or trying to beat them in fantasy sports. To give myself an edge, I build apps that gather, clean, and transform data, and then deliver insights and recommendations. This blog is a place to show off some of these personal projects which will often be focused on me trying to beat my friends.
