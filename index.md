## Ian Varonin's Blog

Hello! My name is Ian Varonin and I have been passionate finding edges since I picked up poker as a part-time job in college. After graduating, I took a shot a playing poker profressionally (wasn't for me) and eventually found my passion in data science. I still love to compete, which these days tends to mean trying to be better than my friends at picking the results of sports games or beating them in fantasy sports. To give myself an edge, I build apps that gather, clean, and transform data, and then deliver me insights and recommendations. This blog is a place to show off some of my personal projects which will often be focused on trying to beat my friends.

In addition to data science and competing against my friends, I am obsessed with Spanish, having spent years studying it and having lived in Colombia for the better part of a year. My goal is to build a life that will allow me to combine my passions for data science and sports and my love for Spanish.
