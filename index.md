## Ian Varonin's Blog

Hello and welcome to my blog! I am a former profressional poker player and a current data scientist. I love to compete with friends in sports picking and fantasy sports leagues and am always looking for edges. This blog is a place to show off some of my work which will often be focused on beating my friends.
