## Ian Varonin's Data Blog

Hi there and welcome to Ian Varonin's Data Blog! Ian Varonin has been obsessed with finding edges ever since he picked up poker as a part-time job during college. After graduating, Ian took a shot a playing poker profressionally (wasn't for him) and eventually found his passion in data science. He still loves to compete, which these days tends to mean trying to be better than his friends in their silly sports picking leagues (which he takes way too seriously) or trying to beat them in fantasy sports. To give himself an edge, he builds apps that gather, clean, and transform data, and then deliver insights and recommendations. This blog is a place to show off some of these personal projects which will often be centered on Ian using data to try to beat his friends.
