# About

I have been passionate about of looking for edges since I was college and I picked up poker as a part-time job. After graduating, I took a shot a playing poker profressionally (wasn't for me) and eventually found my passion in data science. I still love to compete, which these days tends to mean participating in various sports picking leagues with friends and competing against them in fantasy sports. To give myself an edge, I spend time building apps that gather, clean, and transform data, and then deliver insights and recommendations. This blog is a place to show off some of my personal projects which will often be focused on trying to beat my friends.
